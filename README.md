A multi-tier enterprise application consists of two types of objects: application logic components and persistent data objects. 
Application logic components represent actions and define methods that perform common tasks such as calculating the order price, customer credit card billing and so on. 
Session beans model the application logic components as they contain the logic to perform the application tasks.
